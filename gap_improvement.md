# Gaps and Suggested Improvements

## Identified Gaps

- **Incomplete Automated Detection**  
  AWS GuardDuty and CloudWatch are not fully leveraged for proactive threat detection and response.

- **Inconsistent Encryption Enforcement**  
  Data encryption policies are not uniformly applied across all AWS services and environments.

- **Lack of Formalized Post-Incident Review**  
  There is no structured process to capture lessons learned, identify root causes, or update procedures following incidents.

## Suggested Improvements

1. **Strengthen Automated Threat Detection**  
   - Fully enable and configure **AWS GuardDuty** to detect unauthorized or malicious behavior in real time.  
   - Implement **AWS CloudWatch Alarms** and **AWS Config Rules** to trigger automated actions and alert teams to anomalies.

2. **Enforce End-to-End Data Encryption**  
   - Mandate encryption for all data **at rest** and **in transit** using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** across services like S3, RDS, and EBS.  
   - Regularly audit encryption configurations to ensure compliance.

3. **Establish a Formal Post-Incident Review Process**  
   - Create a repeatable post-incident review framework that includes:  
     - **Root cause analysis**  
     - **Actionable remediation steps**  
     - **Documentation of lessons learned**  
     - **Policy and playbook updates**

## Best Practices to Follow

- **Adhere to NIST SP 800-53**  
  Implement recommended security controls for risk management and incident response.

- **Align with ISO/IEC 27001**  
  Ensure the information security management system (ISMS) aligns with international standards.

- **Automate Where Possible**  
  Use **AWS Lambda** and **Step Functions** to orchestrate incident response actions and minimize response time.

- **Test Regularly**  
  Conduct simulated incident response exercises to ensure readiness and identify weaknesses.
