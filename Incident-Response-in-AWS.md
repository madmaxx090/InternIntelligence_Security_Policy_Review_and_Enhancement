# Incident Response Plan Policy for AWS

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents within the AWS environment. The goal is to ensure a consistent, efficient, and effective response to security incidents to minimize potential damage to the organization's resources and data.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all AWS resources and services used by the organization. It covers the following stages of incident response:
- Detection
- Analysis
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery

## 3. Incident Response Lifecycle

### A. Detection
The first step in the incident response process is the detection of suspicious activity or a security breach. AWS offers several tools for monitoring and detecting incidents:

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Utilize CloudWatch to monitor logs, metrics, and alarms for unusual activity across all AWS resources. Set up alarms for:
  - Unusual login attempts or access from unexpected locations.
  - Abnormal changes to resources, such as unauthorized changes to security groups, IAM policies, or bucket policies.
  - Unusual network traffic patterns indicating a DDoS attack or data exfiltration.

**Implementation:**
- Configure **CloudWatch Logs** to track access logs, AWS service logs, and other relevant data sources.
- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to trigger when predefined thresholds are crossed (e.g., login failures, unauthorized access to critical resources).

### B. Analysis
Once an incident is detected, it is important to analyze the nature and scope of the issue. The incident response team should immediately start gathering relevant data for forensic analysis.

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Enable **CloudTrail** to log API calls made within the AWS account, providing detailed records of user activity.
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Use **GuardDuty** to continuously monitor for malicious or unauthorized behavior, such as unusual API calls, potential data exfiltration, or compromised instances.

**Implementation:**
- Use CloudTrail to collect logs from all AWS services and investigate the source of suspicious activity.
- Cross-reference CloudWatch Logs, CloudTrail logs, and GuardDuty findings to piece together a timeline of the incident.

### C. Containment
Containment involves preventing the incident from spreading further. The goal is to limit the impact on systems, data, and services.

- **AWS Lambda**: Leverage **AWS Lambda** to automate containment actions such as:
  - Isolating compromised resources by removing them from the network or disabling access.
  - Blocking malicious IPs by updating security group rules or AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules.
  - Locking down IAM accounts or disabling credentials associated with the incident.

**Implementation:**
- Trigger a Lambda function automatically via CloudWatch alarms to isolate the compromised resource, restrict access, or shut down affected instances.
- Use **AWS Security Hub** to get a comprehensive view of security alerts and ensure rapid containment across the entire environment.

### D. Eradication
Eradication focuses on removing the root cause of the incident from the environment to prevent recurrence.

- **AWS Systems Manager**: Use **Systems Manager** to perform automated remediation tasks, such as patching vulnerabilities, rotating credentials, or applying configuration changes.
- **Amazon Inspector**: Run **Inspector** assessments to identify any residual vulnerabilities or compromised resources within the environment.

**Implementation:**
- Run a detailed scan using Amazon Inspector to identify vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could have been exploited.
- Use Systems Manager to patch vulnerable instances and update IAM roles to limit exposure.

### E. Recovery
The recovery stage involves restoring normal operations while ensuring that no traces of the incident remain.

- **AWS Backup**: Utilize **AWS Backup** to restore critical data and services from backup, ensuring that the recovery is done from a known, clean state.
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** and **Auto Scaling**: Use ELB and Auto Scaling to ensure that the infrastructure scales appropriately and can handle the load during recovery without compromising security.

**Implementation:**
- Restore compromised instances or resources from a known, secure backup using AWS Backup.
- Use ELB and Auto Scaling to ensure the environment is robust and can scale as needed during recovery.

## 4. Incident Response Team
The incident response team should consist of members with various roles, including:
- **Incident Manager**: Leads the incident response effort.
- **Security Analysts**: Perform analysis and containment.
- **System Administrators**: Help with containment and remediation of the affected AWS resources.
- **Legal/Compliance Officers**: Ensure that regulatory requirements are met during the response process.
- **Communications**: Responsible for internal and external communication regarding the incident.

## 5. Post-Incident Review
After the incident has been contained and systems have been recovered, a post-incident review should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the response and identify areas for improvement.

- **Lessons Learned**: Identify what went well, what could be improved, and implement changes to the incident response plan.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Perform a root cause analysis to understand how the incident occurred and how it could have been prevented.
- **Update Policies**: Review and update security policies, practices, and AWS configurations based on findings from the incident.

## 6. Incident Response Automation
- **AWS Lambda**: Automate response actions such as disabling accounts, isolating resources, or updating firewalls based on CloudWatch or GuardDuty triggers.
- **AWS Step Functions**: Use **Step Functions** to orchestrate and automate incident response workflows, coordinating different AWS services and human actions in the process.
