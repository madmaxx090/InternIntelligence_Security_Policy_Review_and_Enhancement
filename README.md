# InternIntelligence – AWS IAM Password Policy Review

## 📌 Task Overview
This task focuses on reviewing and improving the IAM password policy used in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to apply real-world standards like NIST and ISO/IEC 27001 to enhance the security posture of cloud access controls.

## 🔍 What I Did
